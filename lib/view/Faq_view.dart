Since the energy generated by the photovoltaic system can also be used for other consumers in the household, the surplus for charging the electric car results from the energy generated by the photovoltaic system minus all energies that are used in the household (e.g. washing machine, stove, light...) . The information on how much excess energy is currently available to charge the car, can be determined with an additional meter in the house installation and sent to the wall box via an interface (EEBUS or Modbus). The SMA converter offers its own information interface for this purpose, which can also be understood by the wall box.',

The integrated charger in the electric car converts this alternating current into direct current to charge the batteries. Technical errors can occur on both the AC side (from the wall box to the electric car\'s onboard charger) and the DC side (downstream of the onboard charger to the battery). If these faults are not recognized directly, this can lead to dangerous voltages being applied to touchable parts of the Wallbox or the electric car, which can cause dangerous body currents if a person touches them. To prevent this, monitoring devices are installed that detect these errors directly, stop charging and electrically separate the wall box and the car from each other. This both on the AC side and on the DC side. The more expensive monitoring of DC fault currents is already integrated in the wall box with DC fault protection. The fault protection on the AC side must be implemented using a commercially available residual current circuit breaker (type A) in the building installation.',

This can be particularly useful in apartment buildings, in parking lots or other places where several wall boxes are operated in parallel. If, for example, a total power of 30kW is available for four wallboxes (since the electrical network does not provide more power at this point), without DLM each wallbox should use a maximum of 30kW/4 = 7.5kW, since this cannot be ruled out It is possible that all wallboxes are charging at the same time and then there is an overload. In this case, charging all wall boxes without DLM with their maximum output of 11kW would overload the grid connection with a total output of 44kW (4x11kW = 44kW). In this case, the wall boxes would have to be throttled to 7.5 kW. The DLM now makes it possible to effectively distribute the charging power to the four wall boxes in our example. If only one or two wallboxes are occupied, they can then charge with 11kW instead of the throttled 7.5kW charging power. If a further, third wall box is occupied, the charging power is shared between the three wall boxes (30kW/3 = 10kW), etc. so they can then charge with 11kW instead of throttled with 7.5kW charging power. If a further, third wall box is occupied, the charging power is shared between the three wall boxes (30kW/3 = 10kW), etc. so they can then charge with 11kW instead of throttled with 7.5kW charging power.
